    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Purpose</title>
      <para>Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) is a free open-source laboratory information system (LIS). It is primarily utilized in Africa, is an initiative of the Computing for Good (C4G) program at Georgia Institute of Technology, the CDC and participating countries. BLIS was chosen by APHL/CDC and Kenya LIMS stakeholders as the laboratory information system to be implemented for a pilot roll-out in Bungoma and Kapsabet District Hospitals. </para>
      <para> 
This document describes in detail the system design, requirements specification and implementation details. The described system design also captures the modifications that are being as it is customized BLIS to fit the requirements for Bungoma and Kapsabet Laboratories. Scope

      <title>Scope</title>
      <para>This project focuses on the implementation and customization of BLIS for the Kenya LIMS project. The initial version supports the lab procedures which include order management, inventory/commodity management and reporting. The system design supports the addition of additional modules and data types as they emerge. The availability of an open source LIMS will ultimately allow a distributed development model in which additional modules can be contributed by other centers and ability to interface with other EMR systems can be easily achieved.

      <title>System Architecture</title>
      <para>BLIS operates in a networked environment as illustrated  </para>
      <graphic fileref="img/sys_doc/blis-network.png" align="center"/>
      <para>BLIS can be hosted in a laboratory server and can be accessible from any computer and instrument on the LAN. Lab equipment is interfaced through the network for instruments that are equipped with a NIC card. Lab equipment that is equipped with RS-232 serial connectors for passing data are connected to the lab PC. BLIS pulls the database periodically for any new results so that they are aggregated for report generation and submission to clinicians.</para>

    <section>
      <title>System Modules</title>
      <para>The system includes different modules to handle specific functions in the laboratory environment. The following figure indicates modules that have been implemented and modified in BLIS to meet the requirements of Bungoma and Kapsabet District Hospitals.</para>
      <graphic fileref="img/sys_doc/modules.png" align="center"/>
      <section>
        <title>Laboratory Equipment</title>
        <para>These are the instruments that are used in carrying out the various tests on different specimens collected in the hospital laboratory. A module  interfaces the instruments with BLIS so that results are sent directly to the system.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Other Systems (EMR)</title>
        <para>This is where electronic data interchange has been implemented. The module created facilitates data exchange between the LIS and other systems. The LIS receives laboratory orders from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and sends results to EMR. It is operable with other information systems</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Users</title>
        <para>This module manages system users, roles, permissions and access levels.  This ensures that any user that interacts with the LIS is limited to specialized roles and permissions. This prevents cross-functional conflicts between different laboratory user roles.</para>
        <para>
Different users have access to the LIS based upon their role in the organization and the data they need access to. Users can log in using a username and a password. This provides a standard level of security in the system so that non-authorized users cannot have access to lab information or be able to change any data. Also users can be added or deleted at any time.
</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Patients</title>
        <para>The LIS maintains information on all individuals that are assigned any tests in the lab. Certain users may be able to change patient information depending on their roles. The patient management function allows for all lab tests done for a specific person over time to be linked to that particular individual. It also handles patient data imports from other EMR systems.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Providers</title>
        <para>Providers are either individuals or organizations that submit specimens for testing to a lab. The LIS keeps a record of all providers that have the ability to send specimens and receive results.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Tests</title>
        <para>The LIS manages all the tests and procedures that are carried out by the lab, allowing for different tests to be grouped into categories if needed. Tests may be identified using standard codes such as LOINC (Logical Observations Identifiers Names and Codes) or CPT (Current Procedural Terminology). The LIS allows for tests to be added, deleted or modified from the Test Catalog.</para>
        <para>
It also includes the functional requirements of the processes after a specimen has been received and registered in the LIS and before the result data is available for dissemination. Manual entry of results or automatic capture from a lab instrument, flagging of abnormal values etc. are all required functions of the LIS.
</para>
        <para>The LIS also maintains information related to the test results including entry and reporting. Users have limited access to results based on their roles and only certain individuals have the authority to modify results. Reference ranges are also included.
</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Specimen</title>
        <para>The LIS allows for information regarding the handling of specimens from the time they are received at the lab all the way to disposal. Unique identification, including labeling of the sample and all of its aliquots, is required so that results can be matched back to the originating sample. Additionally, samples may be sent to third parties for confirmatory testing or as overflow.
</para>
        <para>Besides the sequential processing from receiving through testing, specimens and samples may spend time in intermediate storage, as well as be stored for subsequent testing following the initial testing or stored as evidence. Long-term specimen and sample storage may also be required, including products/organisms grown from them.  This LIS keeps track of every stage that the specimen goes through including registration, short term and long term storage.
</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Inventory</title>
        <para>The LIS provides capability to manage various aspects of inventory control such as ordering, tracking, and distribution for all items inventoried by a laboratory. Examples include specimen and sample collection kits, testing kits, lab supplies, chemicals, equipment, and forms.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Billing</title>
        <para>The LIS obtains billing information from the submitter requesting the test or other entities, tabulate the items to be billed, apply appropriate billing rates, and create the invoices and supporting billing documentation.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Quality Assurance/Quality Controls</title>
        <para>The system maintains quality control checking (directly from instruments or via manual input) and cumulative weekly and monthly quality control reports. The laboratory  defines QC parameters and features test procedure type.</para>
        <para>
It also allows for managing the maintenance of laboratory equipment, maintenance records etc. including reminders for maintenance and servicing.
</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Reports</title>
        <para>The LIS generates and delivers reports in either hard copy or electronic format to authorized users. These reports are stored or generated ad hoc and allows the user to view data on requests received, specimens registered, pending results, workload etc. The user is  able to define the types of reports they need.</para>

    <title>Functional Requirements</title>
    <para>The functional requirements for a system describe what the system should do. They are statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs, and how the system should behave in particular situations. Below is an outline of the services the LIS should provide.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Specimen Registration and Processing</title>
      <para>Patients who require laboratory services must be referred for those services by a doctor, nurse or other medical care provider.  Consequently, patients must see one of these individuals before laboratory services can be performed.  These clinicians see patients in a variety of places including at separate clinics or wards within hospitals and at standalone clinics or health stations. Typically, laboratory test request orders are initiated by a clinician who fills out a test request.  While the data required in the form is usually the same, the format of request forms used within the health care system may vary from place to place.  The sample may be taken in the ward for in-patients or in a sample collection area for out-patients.  Often these sample collection areas are a part of the laboratory reception area, although that is not always the case. The physical orientation of the hospital and the logistics of the laboratory often determine where the sample collection takes place.  In addition, some samples are taken external to the hospital (for example, at home for stool samples) and brought to the laboratory.  Regardless of where the sample is taken, the sample request information must be logged into the LIS, along with required demographic information, and matched with the patient sample.
</para>
      <para>A unique specimen identifier for each sample (or sample number) that can be placed on the sample and the sample request form should be generated through the LIS.
</para>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>System should allow for rejection of specimen right at specimen receipt.  This will complete the testing cycle for this specimen.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>System should support the ability to perform a quick entry (not all patient demographics are entered) so that a specimen ID is assigned, tests are assigned, barcode labels printed and testing can begin.  Full demographics can be entered at any time before reporting is done</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>System should support complete order entry and assigns a unique specimen identifier with a bar coded label to each sample</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>The system should maintain a complete audit trail of order process.  This audit trail MUST be visibly accessible to an authorized LIMS user Auditing should  include:
</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Status of each change that an order undergoes
</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>The system should have the ability to search for previous patient information to link current request with previous demographics; when a returning patient is found, system must be able to pre-populate demographic information with the ability to edit and save.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/>
        <para>The system should have the ability to refer samples to another laboratory for testing if the testing is not performed at their laboratory.  The system must be able to maintain the record of this referral and allow for the entering of result data when received from referral laboratory</para>
      </section>

        <para>Generally requisition forms used by hospitals and clinicians to request laboratory analysis in the Kenya public health laboratories are standardized, although there may be slight differences between laboratories.  The Kenya TWG has tentative plans to standardize these requisition forms across the country. The following patient and specimen data fields should be expected in this standardized form and required in a LIS:

      <title>Testing and Results Entry</title>
      <para>Every effort should be made to decrease the amount of data entry required for analysts.  Data that have been previously entered into the LIS should not have to be re-keyed for any reason.  Data required by analytical instrumentation to ensure sample identification and to meet QA/QC requirements should be uploaded from the instrument if the instrumentation supports electronic transfer of data.  In addition, results of analyses should be subsequently downloaded into the LIS along with identifying information to link test results with the correct sample.  When automatic uploading and/or downloading of data are not possible, steps should be introduced to simplify and automate the transmission of data into or from the LIS application. The table below summarizes the above. Users should comment and add any notes/information.</para>

      <para>LIS should have the capability of capturing and reporting data for the range of clinical diagnostic tests associated with diseases of public health.  The following list represents potential tests that could be analyzed in the Kenya Phase III laboratories and should be included in any LIS application.  Not all laboratories have the capability of performing all these tests and there may be other tests performed that are not on this list.  This list, however, represents the majority of tests performed in the Kenya laboratories.</para>

      <title>Operations Monitoring</title>
      <para>Comprehensive monitoring of the entire production LIS environment (hardware, network, application, OS, security, etc.) is critical. An effective monitoring solution can often predict and fix problems before they adversely affect the end users of the application. An effective monitoring system should be implemented and operated by support personnel.</para>

      <title>Storage, Back-Up and Disaster Recovery</title>
      <para>The LIS should have the capability to perform routine backups of the data in the system. The LIS must have the ability to do both manual and scheduled data backups. The data backups must be done to a storage media that can be stored off-site and should also provide for the ability to do backups to remote connected devices as well. The system must provide for data restore and recovery capabilities as well.</para>

      <title>Security</title>
      <para>Server user login accounts should be limited to few trusted personnel involved in the setup and/or maintenance of the LIS application.
</para>
      <para>An anti-virus application should be installed, running and kept up to date with virus signatures on all LIS servers, and should be configured to perform weekly full scans of the system. The anti-virus application should also be configured to automatically trigger alerts to support personnel in the event of virus detection.
</para>
      <para>The LIS production server should be hosted behind an Internet firewall that enforces and monitors all Internet traffic to the application. The LIS servers should be configured to open only the TCP/IP ports that are required by the application.
</para>
      <para>The system needs to authenticate, enforce and maintain unique system wide user id and password credentials, for every user that has been granted access to the system. The application should only allow authenticated users access to system. The system automatically logs off users after a certain amount of inactivity. All user passwords in the database are encrypted and can be deciphered only by backend server modules. All passwords are transmitted and stored in encrypted fashion.
</para>
      <para>Every user that has been granted access to the LIS must be assigned a specific Role to play in the system. The user role defines a set of privileges for the particular user.
</para>
      <para>The system needs to track and log all critical interactions with the user including capturing the identity of the user, the user&apos;s action, and the timestamp of the action.

      <title>Support</title>
      <para>The facility management should appoint an internal resource to oversee the day to day running of the LIS and installation of updates from the vendor.
</para>
      <para>The LIS server infrastructure should be hosted in a controlled environment with adequate power, physical security, cooling, and UPS battery backup in the event of temporary power interruption.</para>
      <para>The facility management should define a technical support process to enable the laboratory to submit support requests in the event of problems or issues with the LIS. Incidents should be submitted either by phone, email, or using a web form. The vendor and management should agree on a technical support process.
</para>
      <para>Procedures for change control need to be put in place to address application software upgrades such as resolving of critical bugs related to the LIS in a timely fashion and implementation of any minor enhancements or updates related to the application.

      <title>Procedures while System is Down</title>
      <para>In case of a system or database breakdown the users must have the ability to manually accession the specimens and enter data into a separate local database or tool designed for temporary use. Upon successful restoration of the database following the outage there must be a mechanism to transmit the manually collected data to the LIS system or reenter it with the assigned accession numbers.</para>
